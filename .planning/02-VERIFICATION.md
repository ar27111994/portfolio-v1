# Phase 02 Verification

## Scope
Phase 02 verification covers the four implemented Phase 02 plan slices already landed on `feat/live-deployment-open-tickets`:
- `02-1-PLAN.md` — homepage conversion / offer and hire path cleanup
- `02-2-PLAN.md` — runtime/performance/font/metadata cleanup
- `02-3-PLAN.md` — testimonial proof section
- `02-4-PLAN.md` — case-study proof section

## Requirement Coverage Matrix
- `REQ-03` → covered by `02-1`
  - Evidence: `src/pages/index.astro`, `src/components/UpworkPortfolioCard.astro`, `src/styles/global.css`
- `REQ-04` → covered by `02-2`
  - Evidence: `src/layouts/Layout.astro`, `src/pages/index.astro`, `src/styles/global.css`, `README.md`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `package.json`
- `REQ-05` → covered by `02-3`
  - Evidence: `src/pages/index.astro`, `src/styles/global.css`, testimonial source-link surfacing, local UAT artifacts
- `REQ-06` → covered by `02-4`
  - Evidence: `src/pages/index.astro`, `src/styles/global.css`, public GitHub/release/launch proof links, local UAT artifacts

## Checks Run
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run check`
- `npm audit --omit=dev --json`
- browser DOM/console verification against local preview for `/` and `/privacy`

## Results
- `npm run lint` → passed
- `npm run typecheck` → passed
- `npm run build` → passed
- `npm run check` → passed
- Browser console on homepage → no JS errors captured
- Browser DOM verification on homepage confirmed:
  - H2 sections include `Selected work with visible proof behind it`
  - 3 case-study cards present (`Webhook Debugger and Logger`, `agent-harness`, `penpot-mcp`)
  - 5 testimonial cards present
  - section-anchor nav still exposes `Services`, `Work`, `Upwork`, `Credentials`, `Contact`, `Products`, `Privacy`
- Browser verification on `/privacy` confirmed:
  - title `Privacy Policy — Ahmed Rehan`
  - H1 `Privacy Policy`
  - local-only/cloud-assisted copy is still present

## Security / dependency status
- Production audit has improved from the older issue snapshot (`#21`) and now reports 2 remaining advisories instead of 4:
  - `js-yaml@4.1.1` → moderate DoS advisory (transitive via `astro` and `@vercel/node` chains)
  - `esbuild@0.27.x` → low Windows dev-server file-read advisory (still present through the `@vercel/node` toolchain and nested Vite/dev tooling)
- `astro` is now upgraded to `^7.0.3`
- `@astrojs/sitemap` is now upgraded to `^3.7.3`
- The remaining advisories are not in the shipped homepage code path itself; they are transitive package-chain issues that still resolve inside installed dependency graphs.

## Notes
- `scripts/fetch-portfolio-build.mjs` was hardened so timestamp-only portfolio refreshes no longer rewrite `src/data/upwork-portfolio.json` during builds.
- Ticket `#14` has now been reconciled and closed against the current branch state: surfaced homepage wording avoids the original unsubstantiated Microsoft/Anthropic partner-style claims and limits visible credential language to defensible text such as `Anthropic course track` with linked verification context.
- Ticket `#21` remains open, but its scope is now narrower: the current branch reduces the production audit state to 2 remaining transitive advisories rather than the older 4-advisory snapshot.

## Final Verification Verdict
- Phase 02 implementation is locally verified and stable for release handoff.
- Remaining work is now release hygiene plus the residual upstream dependency exposure tracked in `#21`, not core functionality repair.
